# AIT-Postal-System

## Introduction
This project was made to solve one of the problem in my college i.e. Mails. So, in my college wheneve we get mails, the staff makes a list of People who got mails and attached it to the notice board. So it's a very tedious task for us to check for mails everyday. Due to which most of us are not aware of our mails and generally miss some good opportunity.

That's why this postal system is created. With this, the person who used to make the list can update the data in the database and the system will automatically send an email to the student, telling about the mail he/she has recieved and will urge to take it from the store. This system will also take follow up from the student whether he/she has recieved it or not.
